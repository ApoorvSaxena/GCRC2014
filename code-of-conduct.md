The purpose of Garden City Ruby Conference is to encourage and foster the growth of ruby community in Bangalore by providing a quality platform for rubyists to meet and learn from each other.

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a volunteer or conference organizers immediately. The conference Organizers or Volunteers can be identifiable by their badge. Please contact any of these individuals, if the matter is especially urgent:
