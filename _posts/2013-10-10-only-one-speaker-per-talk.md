**All talks at #GCRC14 will be with only one speaker. Except in very special cases.**

A few talk proposals at #GCRC14 come through with two speakers recently. Talks with 2 speakers are very unusual at regional ruby conferences. RubyConf India events seem to have set a precedent of having many 2-speaker talks with no special justification for having 2 speakers.

A common reason why people pair up while giving a conference talk is because they feel it is an easier task with 2 people on stage. 

However, as [Leah Silber](https://twitter.com/wifelette) - the organizer of [Golden Gate Ruby Conference](http://gogaruco.com) - explains, that doesn't work according to the speakers' expectations:

>I'm not a huge fan of 2-speaker talks. Which is to say, in my experience the second speaker rarely adds enough value to account for their comped pass or anything, really. 

>In fact, in more cases than not, **it leads to a far more scattered talk, with poorly divided up responsibility, and rocky flow**. 

>Writing and delivering your first talk is indeed hard; needing to account for a second speaker's nerves, idiosyncrasies and workflow doesn't really make that easier. The exception to this rule are people who are already good at speaking, and have a track record of being a pair. A la Ryan and Eric back in the day. Or Damon and Ron Evans. Tom and Yehuda :p 

>In those sorts of cases, double the speaker can often mean double the awesome. 

2 speaker talks - when they are successful - are among the most memorable of conference talks. One such talk I have seen is by Uncle Bob Martin and Micah Martin at RubyConf 2011, the video of which is below:

As can be seen from the video, the talk involved a hell lot of preparation from two people who have done a whole lot of public speaking and presentations before. 

It is justifiable to have 2 speakers in such cases. 

However, having a 2 speaker talk just because either of the speakers are scared to do it alone is an injustice to the audience, and doesn't help the speakers as well. 

Talk proposals with 2-speakers at #GCRC14 will be judged along these lines by the selection panel.
