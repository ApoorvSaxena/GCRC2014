Getting the wifi and internet connectivity at a technical conference is hard. See [How to make WIFI work at tech conferences (Part 1 of N)](http://www.nonblocking.io/2011/05/how-to-make-wifi-work-at-tech.html) and [The conference wifi checklist](http://thilo.me/post/62067077735/the-conference-wifi-checklist) for the intricacies involved.

Garden City Ruby Conference will have 200 participants at the venue with multiple devices connecting to the internet. In addition, there will be 50/100/200 people watching the live-stream of the talks on [http://www.justin.tv/confreaks](http://www.justin.tv/confreaks)

We need someone to be the main person responsible for all aspects of wifi and internet connectivity at the conference. 

If you are interested in taking on this role, please send a short note to [team@gardencityruby.org](mailto:team@gardencityruby.org) with what interests you about this role by EOD Monday Sep 30th. 

The team will select one person for the role. The selected person will get a complimentary ticket to the conference, and the gratitude of the organizing team and the community for a job well-done.
