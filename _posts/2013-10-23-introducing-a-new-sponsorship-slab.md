We have received a good feedback on the sponsorship slabs from the community and all the potential sponsors. We felt, there is definitely a huge gap between Associate and Silver Packages. Many sponsors wished we had a slab in between.

To fill in the gap, we have introduced a new slab called 'Associate Plus'. Check out the [latest prospectus](http://www.gardencityruby.org/sponsors) for more details.

**'Associate Plus' package is ideal for startups and small companies seeking visibility for their products and services among the top-notch ruby developers.**

If you are interested in sponsoring #GCRC14, drop us a line at [sponsors@gardencityruby.org](mailto:sponsors@gardencityruby.org).
