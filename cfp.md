Submit your talk proposals at [https://gardencityruby2014.busyconf.com/proposals/new](https://gardencityruby2014.busyconf.com/proposals/new)

Proposals will be accepted until Friday Oct 25th at midnight IST. Proposals are reviewed on a rolling basis as they are submitted.

Talks will be 30 minutes with no extra time for questions. Remember that nearly all our attendees use Ruby daily, so talks should be targeted to an audience of beginner, intermediate or advanced Rubyists. Non-Ruby topics are acceptable if they are somehow related to Ruby, or just seriously awesome.

If your talk is selected you will receive a free pass to attend the conference and get some special speaker swag too. There is no associated travel budget for speakers.

Please send any questions to email [team@gardencityruby.org](mailto:team@gardencityruby.org)
